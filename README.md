# Hi, I'm Julian Santamaria!

I work in Quality Assurance Automation.
Focused on Test and Process Automation mainly using Cypress.io

#### ðŸ’»My Tech stack:

- Cypress.io
- Cucumber
- VSCode
- Git
- MySQL
- Postman
- JavaScript

#### ðŸ¤– My Test Automation projects:

- JuiceShop: In this project I create scripts to make a purchase in JuiceShop website from scratch, that means creating an account, then login, create an address, select it and checkout. In this project I 'm using Cypress.Commands
- AysaLoginTest:  First part of a Login test for an important water company in Argentina. Although this is a little project this is an important one for me since was the first real automation work I made in automation testing.
- TradeMeProject: This is a real interview project that I resolved using Cypress. The project is based on testing the quantity of products in some searches criteria.
- AmznPorject: On this project I'm testing the Amazon search functionality. I use Page Object Model with Cypress
